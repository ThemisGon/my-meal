## Architecture (Multi-Agent System)
The system is composed of multiple collaborative agents and tools working in a structured agentic workflow:
### Agents

| Agent Name             | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UserProfileAgent`     | Extracts structured user information (goals, allergies, preferences, etc.) from free-form text   |
| `MealPlannerAgent`     | Generates a meal plan based on user profile and selected plan scope (meal/day/month)             |
| `MealEvaluationAgent`  | Evaluates the generated meal plan against user constraints and offers feedback/suggestions   |
| `EnhancedDetectionAgent` | Scans the plan for allergenic ingredients using text parsing and cross-checking        |

### Tools

| Tool Name              | Function                                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CaloriesCalculator`   | Uses Nutritionix API to estimate caloric content for each food item                          |
| `IngredientExtractorTool` | Extracts potential ingredients from meal plan text using regular expressions               |
